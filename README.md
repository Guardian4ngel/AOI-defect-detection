# AOI-defect-detection

Automated Optical Inspection(AOI) is a critical technique which is used in the manufacture and test of electronics printed circuit boards, PCBs and so on. AOI defect detection allows us to inspect is there any defects on electronics assemblies or in particular PCBs fastly and accurately. It is the method to ensure that the quality of product can be built correctly and without manufacturing faults.
